I'll provide code using ResNet-50 as a classification model to distinguish between "Field" and "Road" classes.  I'll use PyTorch to implement the model, data augmentation and network training. 

### Here are the main steps:

#### 1. Import the necessary libraries.
#### 2. Load and pre-process the data.
#### 3. Define pre-trained ResNet-50 model.
#### 4. Configure model training with data augmentation.
#### 5. Train the model.
#### 6. Evaluate model
